To run the AM assembler you need to set the following alias

alias AM  '/usr/bin/sml @SMLload=/home/411/AM/am+.x86-linux'

You can run the assembler/interpreter in three modes:
 
(1) In debug mode:
 
        AM -d <filename>

(2) In normal mode:

        AM <filename>

(3) In "interactive" mode (no arguments):

        AM


This director contains several test files:

test1.am+             adds 5 to the read in value
test2.am+             reads in two numbers compares them 
                      in one case it multiplies them
                      in the other it divides them
test3.am+             calculates a^b ... this is the implementation 
                      of a recursive minisculus function with non-local 
                      references.
....


The description of the stack machine is in the file 

AM.spec         specification of stack machine



WARNING: currently the assembler simply exits on a syntax error or a 
         file error with no message (so you have to get it right!!)
         I may get round to changing this!
